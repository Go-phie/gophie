    I was visiting my favourite low data movie download site, but that day was particularly annoying. I moved to click and kept getting redirected to nude pictures. I just want free movies, I cried. Bisoncorps then proceeded to create Gophie. It is a CLI tool which enables you to be the cheapskate you are without getting guilt tripped. It was eventually turned into a functional API to enable searching and listing of movies.

    ## Applications

    Gophie is available as a CLI and has also been used to build several other products

    - [Gophie Web](https://github.com/deven96/gophie-web)
    - [Beetube bot](https://github.com/kodjunkie/beetube-bot)
